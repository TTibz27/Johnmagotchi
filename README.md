This is a project I made for Monogame Jam 5.

It is a quick little tamagatchi- like game, made to fit the theme of "John". 

If you follow the monogame quickstart guides it should be fairly straightforward to load this project after that. 
It was made with VS community 2022 and the most recent release of monogame as of dec 2023.
